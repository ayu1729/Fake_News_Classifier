#Brief explanation of pre-processing of text data--

1.All the characters apart from alphabetical english characters are replaced by space as they do not carry much linguistic information.

2.Stemming of words- All words in the corpus are reduced to their root words like "wash" for "washing","washed" etc  or "cool" for "cooling" or "cold". For classification of authentication of news root information is sufficient.

3.All alphabets are converted to their lowercases.
